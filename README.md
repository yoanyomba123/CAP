# FIN-AM | We Make Finance Easier

## What Is FINAM

FINAM is a  financial  social  networking  platform  that  allows  for  individuals  to  collaborate  and  network  with  other  investors  alike. The driving value proposition provided by FINAM is to serve  as  a  mediator  between  the  investor  and  their  broker  by  providing the user with greater access to their investment data as well as flexibility in interactions with their broker. They  can  then  use  it  as  a  way  of  communicating  with  other  investors  to  gain  a  step  up  in  the  market.  Communication  between  individuals  specific to alpha extraction from the market  is  nothing  new,  but  the  current    rate  of  technological innovation  leaves  an  enormous  amount  of  opportunity  in  improving  those  forms  of  communication  and  the  various  bridges  between  participants  in  the  market.  

Our  mission  is  to  provide  users  with  a  social  platform  that  centralizes  research  and  external/internal  investment  data  to  promote  social  investment  activity.    The  company  aims  to  become  the  primary  social  investment  platform  for  market  participants  in  the  United  States.  We  plan  to  become  industry  leaders  in  customer  loyalty,  data  visualization  and  engagement.  Our  philosophy  is  to  bring  influential  power  back  to  the  people  and  away  from  the  banks.

* [Runnin The App on One's Local Developemnt Server](#running-the-app) – How to run the application.

CAP's Code base  works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.<br>
If something doesn’t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/yoanyomba123/CAP/issues/new).

Note: This application is built with the MERN Stack

## Quick Overview

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yoanyomba123/CAP.git
cd Smart-Network-Development
npm install package.json
npm run client-install
npm run app
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the app on your local server.<br>

### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured through the create-react-app library and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

## Running The App

**You’ll need to have Node >= 6 on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

To run the app, run a single command:

```sh
npm run app
```
Runs the backend in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run app`

Runs the backend and frontend in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view both instances in the browser.

## What’s Included?

This environment has everything we need to interact with a modern React Application:

* React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
* Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
* Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need `-webkit-` or other prefixes.
* A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
* A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
* A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
* An offline-first [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) and a [web app manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/), meeting all the [Progressive Web App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) criteria.
* Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.

Check out [this guide](https://github.com/nitishdayal/cra_closer_look) for an overview of how these tools fit together.

The tradeoff is that **these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way**. I
